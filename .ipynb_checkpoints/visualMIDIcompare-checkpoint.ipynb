    "## Provide:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Spectrograph \n",
    "- ability to play MIDI files to compare\n",
    "- ability to convert to .wav using existing tools\n",

    "Tool to generate a visual representation of a MIDI file. \n",
    "Optionally, compare to a second MIDI file by diffing the images\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Length of the MIDI file (x-axis of image).\n",
    "2. 88 Keys (y-axis of image).\n",
    "3. Plot each note on the image.\n",
    "4. Grayscale to measure velocity (MIDI has 128 levels?)\n",
    "5. Comparision emphasizes:\n",
    "\t1. notes with no match\n",
    "\t2. notes with differnet on/off points\n",
    "\t3. notes with different velocity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reason: \n",
    "\n",
    "MIDI is a digitial format and can fairly straightforwaly be done numerically. This is not broadly useful to people. \n",
    "\n",
    "Existing MIDI editors have a visual editor but it is manual process to extract and line up images, and diff them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- use the same diff rules and colour as github.\n",
    "- command line tool\n",
    "\n",
    "Optional:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add numeric comparisions\n",
    "\t- summary statistcs\n",
    "\t- note statistics\n",
    "2. An interface where you can hover over images and get MIDI details\n",
    "3. Choose output iamge format.\n",
    "4. Choose to wrap the image (it will be a long image by default)\n",
    "5. web interface\n",
    "6. Chouse y-axis scale. Default will be 10px per 1/4 note.\n",
